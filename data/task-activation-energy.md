I have a hard time mustering the effort to take a shower. There’s this enormous buildup before I get in to rinse off where my brain is screaming at me, “No! I don’t want to do that!” But once I get under the water and relax, it’s all fine. I actually enjoy it. I don’t look forward to showers, but once I get over the hill of starting them, I’m good.

In chemistry there's a term called ‘activation energy’ that describes the energy needed to start a chemical reaction. There’s a big chunk of energy that needs to be supplied to get a reaction going. Once it’s started though, the reaction continues like toppling dominoes. Think about like a fire: they can be tricky to start, but they’re not hard to keep going.

I’ve realized while coping with my ADHD that activation energy is a concept that nearly every ADHD person understands, even if they can’t describe it. I'm fairly sure that every ADHD person has had the experience of planning an entire day out, making lists of all of the minutiae of what needs to be done and in what order. Then the day comes… and nothing happens. Instead of following through on their todo list, they get overwhelmed and just ignore it all.

I think this is an issue with the effort it takes to start something. We're able to plan things out in advance fairly easily, writing down _everything_ that needs to be done and putting it in a nice, pretty system. But, when it actually comes down to _doing the shit we planned to do_, the energy it takes to start moving is just too high. The effort required to begin the list is higher than the amount of effort we feel we can exert at the time, so we don't move. This is an underestimation of what I call **task activation energy**. I define this as "the minimum amount of energy required to begin doing a task".

I think part of the reason why this chronic underestimation of task activation energy happens is because we don’t have a _unit_ for this measurement. In science, activation energy is measured in units like joules per mole (J/mol), kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol), or kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol). Activation energy in the real world is a countable, measurable thing that can be extrapolated into comparable units. It’s observed and constant. The same activation energy will always be measured at the same amount. Because of this property, we can compare them objectively to each other. This gives scientists the ability to make better decisions and deductions about things related to their work.

In contrast, task activation energy has no unit: it's inherently subjective. It's something that's internal and varies from person-to-person. It's very hard to describe, and it's only expressed in the context of one amount of it relative to the other amount of it. This is similar to how Marx defines exchange value: it’s only something that exists during comparison, during the act of exchange. Task activation energy can vary depending on the context and the situation because our brains are very complex things with lots of overlapping processes. One task’s activation energy might be just right one day, and the next day it might be way too high. Because this energy is something that exists solely in our heads, it's unpredictable and immeasurable. It’s not objective. We can't compare one person's understanding of task activation energy to another person's understanding of it. Task activation energy is personal.

So with this in mind, how do you become better at discovering your own relative levels of task activation energy? How do you better predict how much effort it will take to start writing that paper before it's due, or to get up in the morning and do a morning routine? How do you stop doing the equivalent of throwing spaghetti against the wall until it sticks?

Well, you experiment.

You start by predicting the relative amount of task activation energy you'll need to complete a given task. You then experiment with that and see if it holds up. If you do the task the next day, it's very likely that you were correct. If you don't, then you go back to the drawing board. When you do this many times, slowly improving on your understanding of your effort limit, you eventually develop a more complete understanding of your 'unit' of task activation energy.

One tool you can use to help with this is the idea of a ‘neutral observer’ from mindfulness. By looking at things from a neutral point of view, and by paying attention to the results of different things you try, you can slowly become better at predicting the energy it takes to start something. The key here is to pay attention without judgement and _without a goal_. You can't beat yourself up for not doing something. You can't say you're doing this to be more productive. You're simply experimenting and being curious about how you behave. Curiosity is sustainable, because there's always something new to uncover, but shame and motivation are not.

So your goal first and foremost is to gain a better understanding of what you are and are not willing to do, and you build on that over time. Doing this should feel like play, and there's no real right way to do it. Maybe you try rewarding yourself immediately after completing a task. Maybe you try splitting up the work into bite-sized chunks. Maybe you sip a Gatorade while you're focusing on a really hard task. You’re just trying different things and learning scientifically from the results.

Once you develop a more thorough understanding of yourself, a system inevitably emerges. You begin to develop generalizations over your 'unit' of task activation energy, and begin to understand the rules of how to manipulate it. For example, if I put a glass of water beside my bed at night, I'm much more likely to drink water as soon as I wake up. If I do my work at my standing desk, I'm much more likely to transition from that to doing some other chore or activity because standing while coding is boring.

You begin to develop your own rulebook - a plethora of tips and tricks that can manipulate the likelihood of getting stuff done. When you work with your ADHD instead of against it, getting things done becomes easier. These sets of tools trick your brain into thinking that something is easier than it actually is.

This toolbox is completely unique to you. Remember, task activation energy is internal: it's not something measurable by anyone else. No amount of tips, tricks, and suggestions from other people will help you. You have to do the experiments yourself. Once you learn more about your ADHD, about how your brain actually thinks and works, things slowly start to get easier. Your life starts to incrementally improve, one small experiment at a time.
