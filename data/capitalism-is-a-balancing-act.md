I'm currently reading through Capital by Karl Marx, and it's proving to be quite interesting. It's a really hard read, but I'm starting to learn about it quite a lot. Capital is basically about the 'gravitational pull' of capitalism and how capital ultimately always leads to terrible things (Marx proposes communism as a good alternative.)

One thing that's helped me understand certain parts of it is the different charts and graphs in commentary to the book (namely in the Study Guide to Capital Volume 1 by Harry Cleaver). In chapter one of the book, Marx talks about **commodities** (things that satisfy a want or need in humans), and how they have to opposite expressions of value: use value and exchange value.

A commodity has a _use value_ because it satisfies a human need and has a certain usefulness to humans. A commodity has an _exchange value_ because it is exchanged for another thing. A commodity becomes a use value if it is used, and a commodity becomes an exchange value if it is exchanged. These are two very opposite, very contradictory things, but a commodity is the unification of the two.

In the same way that a commodity under capitalism is the unification of these two values, so is the class relation in capitalism the unification of two opposite, opposing forces. The ruling capitalist class oppresses the poor and basically wants them dead, but the poor want the ruling class dead because they oppress them. Capitalism is the unification of these two values, the keeping of these two polar opposites in stasis and equilibrium. Capitalism is a balancing act: a series of weird contradictions that somehow balance each other out enough, even though they really shouldn't.

This is possibly part of why the system is so unstable, why every several years the economy just shuts down and has to have the government rescue it. This, possibly, is why capitalism is so shakey yet so powerful, so oppressive that you think it wouldn't survive yet it holds an iron grip on those caught in its midst.

I don't think the word 'balancing act' does enough justice to the system to convey how cruel and inhumane it is, but I think it does illustrate the precariousness and inefficiency of it.
